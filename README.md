# University Management System

## Project Overview

Welcome to my most ambitious project to date â€“ the University Management System developed using the Spring framework. In the coming weeks, I will be creating a robust system that's set to make the lives of university students, lecturers, and department heads easier.

This project will be a web application, and each type of user will have access to different features:

### Students

- **Academic Progress**: Students will be able to see the classes they've completed and their GPA.
- **Assignment and Exam Scores**: Access detailed information about their performance in each homework, quiz, and exam.

### Lecturers

- **Grade Management**: Lecturers will have the exclusive ability to input and manage marks for assignments, quizzes, and exams for their respective courses.

### Department Heads

- **Course Management**: Department heads will have a comprehensive view of the enrolled students in their department's courses.
- **Student Sorting**: They can easily sort and filter students to identify top performers, helping with decisions like selecting students for exchange programs.

## Why This Matters

This project is intended to modernize and improve our university's management system. Currently, we rely heavily on Microsoft services and Microsoft Teams, which may not provide the customized solutions we require. The University Management System is designed to streamline operations and provide a more user-friendly, efficient experience for all stakeholders in the education process.

## Next Steps

I'm excited to embark on this journey, and I'm committed to making this project a success within just a few weeks. It's a significant challenge, but I believe in its potential to transform our university's operations.

Wish me luck, and stay tuned for updates as the project progresses!
